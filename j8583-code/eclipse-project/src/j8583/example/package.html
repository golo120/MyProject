<body>This package contains example code. There are two examples: one is a very simple example that reads a couple of messages from a text file and then generates a message from scratch and prints it out. The other example consists of two programs: a Server application which listens on port 9999 for connections, and when it receives a connection it reads ISO messages from it and sends back responses, and a Client application which connects to the server and sends messages and reads the responses asynchronously. Both Client and Server use the same config file which is in this same package.</body>
